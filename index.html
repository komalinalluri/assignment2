            <p> As his mother died when he was quite young, Kakashi was raised by his father Sakumo Hatake. His father was pretty well known throughout the village and Kakashi wanted to be like him. In one of Sakumo's missions he made the decision to save his comrades rather than complete the mission, thus abandoning his duties.



He was viewed as a disgrace due to his decision and he couldn't take it any longer and committed suicide. After seeing what his father went through. Kakashi thought that he wouldn't make the same mistakes as his father. From that day he realized that the ninja rules must always take priority.
